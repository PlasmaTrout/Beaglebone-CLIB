Usage (Alpha Stages)

To get the source (which you must have done already) do a:

git clone git@bitbucket.org:jdowning/beaglebone-clib.git

For compiling the blinktest application and running it do a:

build_library.sh

this creates the status beaglebone library and installs it in /usr/lib

then run

build_blinktest.sh

and then run by executing..

./blinktest

you will have to hit ctrl-c to stop the blinking. If you need to fully reset
the ports after the application was ran run the following scripts seperately:

echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio38/value 
echo 38 > /sys/class/gpio/unexport

This will shut the power off to pin 3 and then unexport the port.

** Its port 38 because port numbers are notated by taked the actual design name
** of the pin, in this case GPIO1_6, and multiplying 32 by the first number and
** adding the second. So 32x1+6 is the actual pin number. These translations
** are done for you in the C headers so use the macros PIN3, PIN4, ETC and dont
** worry about the actual port unless you are controling the ports via shell.
